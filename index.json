It was tough time when everything I got felt like was falling apart. As music always have been an amazing savior, came to rescue, and Kho Gaya Hu was born. It took merely 40 minutes to get the music and lyrics. It all just came naturally. I was alone in the flat tinkering with my guitar in hot June afternoon.\nThose were the days when my friends were telling me how to prepare a good resume, my dad asked to prepare for government jobs and I had just quit an intern position at a startup, after 5 days at work, as they weren\u0026rsquo;t ready to pay well. And here was me, trying to match the harmony on G major. Along with all this, I had to hold onto the broken heart as well. College was over and it seemed like the end of all good moments.\nWhen nothing feels right, and emotions take a toll on me, music is a good way to distract. Being an invtroverted personality, it is always easy for me to express it all in writing.

And if you think it\u0026rsquo;s free, then it is only till we all get addicted, just like the internet and smartphones.\nThen comes cloud computing when you don\u0026rsquo;t need those graphics renderers and the crazy system requirements for your computer. All CPU, GPU that is required to run a heavy software or game is done on the cloud, all you need is a damn fast internet connection. It isn\u0026rsquo;t too far when XBOX and PS will be obsolete. Google Stadia is almost there to crash it all on gaming.\nWith cloud computing becoming the next big thing, we will only need an interactive screen, a browser, and a cloud provider.

So we are here today to write a gateway microservice using Springboot framework, Netflix\u0026rsquo;s Zuul library, and our never-getting-old programming language Java. As a part of this development, we will be using Gradle to build this together and prepare the Docker image out of it.\nIf you are not sure yet, what this api-service is going to help you with, I recommend reading out What is api-microgateway?.\n First create a Gradle project in your favorite IDE. Update the build.gradle file with following settings -  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  plugins { id \u0026#39;org.springframework.boot\u0026#39; version \u0026#39;2.3.3.RELEASE\u0026#39; id \u0026#39;java\u0026#39; id \u0026#39;application\u0026#39; } apply plugin: \u0026#39;io.spring.dependency-management\u0026#39; dependencies { implementation \u0026#39;org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web\u0026#39; implementation \u0026#39;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-netflix-zuul\u0026#39; }    Refresh your Gradle project to download the defined dependencies from their respective repository. Update your main class of the Java application with SpringBoot and Zuul Annotation as below -  1 2 3 4 5 6 7  @EnableZuulProxy @SpringBootApplication public class ApplicationEntryPoint { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ApplicationEntryPoint.class, args); } }   Now your basic api-gateway is ready to serve but needs to be configured with routing settings.\n   Edge Service or Routing Endpoint  To set up routes, we will modify the application.yaml file which is responsible for helping our spring boot application in reading the dynamic configs.\n Update settings in your application.properties or application.yaml as follows -  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15  spring:application:name:api-serviceserver:port:8080zuul:routes:example:url:https://example.comribbon:eureka:enabled:false  Here in the setting the child property under zuul.routes which is example is the URI path or say serviceId which is responsible for redirecting the request to the targeted endpoint that is mentioned as the value for url property.\nNow you can run your spring-boot application and hit the localhost:8080/example on the browser.\n  So any request that we make after running our application and hitting the endpoint http://localhost:8080/example/xyz will send all requests and headers to downstream service at http://example.com/xyz\nThe response from the downstream service is then sent back and our api-service which in turn sends the response to the requesting client which will be your browser.\n   Security Filters or Request Filter  This is an add-on to your routing service where you can write a filter that can modify your headers or check for Authorization. Basically, any sanitization that needs to be done on the request before sending it further downstream can be applied here.\n  Create a new class RequestFilter.java and extend the abstract class ZuulFilter. As a part of your inherited behavior of ZuulFilter you will then need to override the below mentioned 4 methods :\nshouldFilter() - responsible if you want to enable this filter or not.\nrun() - the logic on how what needs to be done with the request.\nfilterType() - evaluates when this filter need to be applied i.e. pre, post or route.\nfilterOrder() - if there are multiple filters operating, then on what order does it comes.\n  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21  public class RequestFilter extends ZuulFilter { @Override public boolean shouldFilter() { return true; } @Override public Object run() throws ZuulException { RequestContext ctx = RequestContext.getCurrentContext(); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Requested Endpoint : \u0026#34; + ctx.getRequest().getRequestURI()); // all the logic goes here for request manipulation  return null; } @Override public String filterType() { return \u0026#34;pre\u0026#34;; } @Override public int filterOrder() { return 5; } }   Your main application class needs to define the Bean for this request filter to help Zuul servlet chain the filter settings.\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10  @EnableZuulProxy @SpringBootApplication public class ApplicationEntryPoint { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(ApplicationEntryPoint.class, args); } @Bean RequestFilter getRequestFilterBean(){ return new RequestFilter(); }    Similarly you can create a response filter with filterType as Post and that can be used to manipulate the response from your downstream service before sending it back to your browser client.\n A complete sample of this can be found on my git repository -\u0026gt; api-microgateway\n","date":"Jun 11","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/api-microgateway-service-using-netflix-zuul-on-java/","tags":["aws","microservice","java"],"title":"API-microgateway service using Netflix Zuul on Java"},{"categories":["tech"],"contents":"   Routing request to different microservices from a single REST endpoint  Having a single entry point for your all backend microservices in your application comes in handy for the frontend applications. The front end just needs to know one domain to reach for anything. Since in distributed architecture, we have multiple services running, it becomes easier for the frontend client to communicate only with one gateway only without knowing what happens in the background.\nBefore we proceed you need to understand the difference between the three -\n  API Gateway: This is an application layer between the backend and the frontend. It is exposed to the public and provides an abstraction to the client and a seamless experience. Provides a single entry point and can perform operations like IP or MAC filtering, etc. This is commonly used for Monolithic architecture.\n  API MicroGateway: This is similar to API-gateway but used in a microservice architecture, since a single api-gateway is not feasible where all services are running in a distributed fashion, so we end up having multiple micro gateways. We can have an api-microgateway at entry point routing to different subset of your application business, where internally that business module of application may have another api-microgateway to route to different other services. All api-gateway can perform their own authentication or routing, etc.\n  Edge-Proxy Service: This is a service running on the API gateway resolving the proxying, routing, etc. This is just a logical layer. There can be multiple edge-services running on your api-gateway, but practically there is always one.\n   Benefits of using API Microgateway   You can have a single entry point, so your frontend client doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to maintain multiple access points. CORS can be enabled for one service instead of multiple services. Dynamic routing for all requests. Can be very handy for load shedding. All the requests can be authenticated using JWT token before hitting the backend service. All security modules can be applied on the request beforehand, so each backend microservice does not need to worry about it. Fallback cache data or static data can be used if some backend service is unavailable momentarily. This ensures uptime for all services when you have CI/CD going on in the backend. Various request and response filters can be used to log or sanitize the requests or updating headers for the downstream. Global trace ID can be injected in the header that can be used across all services for logging and tracing. Can be connected with service discovery modules like Eureka. Circuit Breaker like Hystrix can be connected for fault tolerance.  The usage of API micro gateway is immense and is one of the most common microservice used across container-based software development at the front door.\nNow we have learned the usage, we will be writing one api-gateway using Netfix\u0026rsquo;s Zuul which is the most popular and commonly used library -\u0026gt; api-microgateway using Netflix zuul on Java Springboot\n","date":"Jun 01","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/api-gateway-vs-edge-proxy-service-vs-api-microgateway/","tags":["cloud","microservices"],"title":"API Gateway vs Edge Proxy service vs API Microgateway"},{"categories":["travel"],"contents":"   I HOLD THAT A STRONGLY MARKED PERSONALITY CAN INFLUENCE DESCENDANTS FOR GENERATIONS. ~ BEATRIX POTTER  Hampi and the lost stories in the ruins.

I reached Joshimath town surrounded by all the beautiful hills from all side. My original plan was to travel more from Joshimath to Raini village which was around 20 kms ahead to stay with my couchsurfing host Vivek Rana. It had snowed recently around the hills and so the villages and Joshimath town were facing electricity cut for a week now. I could not contact him and took a hotel with cheapest cost for 2 days. Today I needed rest and tomorrow I have to spent my day in Auli. Had dinner at a local shop and went to bed.\nBest Chicken at Dhaba opposite to Hotel Trishul, Joshimath\nNext day I went to get the ticket to Auli Ropeway. You would not get the ticket it one go if you have not prebooked. It\u0026rsquo;s not that easy. Its operated by government and now you can understand how it works. So after a lot of pleading to different officials I got a ticket. The ropeway journey made it more amazing. On reaching the top of Auli with all snow all around. I was trying to make balance on such tough landscape. I tried skiing for 3 hours. Gopi, my skiing guide became my friend, and told all the great stories. Fell down for around 20 times while skiing, he picked me up every time. Such great people. Also, the place had a beautiful view. It cleared out my head.\nView from Auli\nAfter having an amazing day, I went back to Joshimath. I realized later in the night how much body pain was there because of the thrilling day, but I smiled. I shivered while wearing my jacket and having the quilt on. It was -9 degree in Joshimath today. But I smiled. And you may ask why? I was thrilled. I was happy. I was on my own. I was my tour guide and I was my guardian. And obviously I was creating the beautiful memories I can later tell stories of, before I get too old.

There weren\u0026rsquo;t many reviews on the web then, so had to figure it ourselves.\nBoat ride to cross the lake to Ratanwadi\nAfter reaching Bhandardara, there we had to take a boat ride to cross the lake and visit the Ratanwadi village. As we reached Ratanwadi, we realised that it was a small place with a temple and very few houses. There was no restaurant and we all were hungry, when a villages agreed to prepare food for all 10 people. We had stunning food and wanted to trek to the Ratanwadi fort, but we were already running late and had least stamina to go for trek.\nAmriteshwar Temple, Ratanwadi village\nSince, we had booked a traveler bus and had to also head back, most of them backed out to go for a trek as it was getting late. So we missed the trek which was supposed to give us the breathtaking view of Mumbai city. But understanding the need of the friends, we skipped the trek and after enjoying the beautiful Ratanwadi village we left back for Mumbai. It was a great day and great village indeed.\n","date":"Dec 05","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/bhandardhara-mumbai-overview/","tags":["maharashtra","bhandardhara","arthur dam"],"title":"Bhandardara - Mumbai Overview"},{"categories":null,"contents":"   There is a thin line between reality and imagination  In Progress.. come back later.\n","date":"Dec 05","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/its-the-will-not-the-skill/","tags":["sprituality"],"title":"It's the will, not the skill"},{"categories":["travel"],"contents":"   LIFE IS EITHER A DARING ADVENTURE OR NOTHING.  There was a time when I wanted to escape office. It was a weekend of November 2015 and we had no plans. Recently one of my friends had shifted to Mysore for work. So I asked my flatmate \u0026amp; friend Aprit, if he is interested in visiting traveling to Mysore to meet our common friend Adarsh. We left at night and took an early morning train from Yeshwantpur Railway Station, Bangalore to Mysore. On reaching Mysore, more plans unravelled and we hired two scooty and then we all three left for Wayanad in Kerala.\nRental scooty at Wayanad\nIt was a tiring ride and driving through Bandipur Tiger Reserve kept us going out of fear. Though we made it to Wayanad by evening. After reaching we just slept and straighten our backs. The next day we planned to explore the beautiful coffee estates and also visited the Edakkal Caves. But we missed visiting Chembra peak because of time constraint. But we managed to enjoy to the fullest on our scooters.\nSome random Coffee estate\nWayanad is a beautifully preserved region of Western Ghats and have scenic beauty of green plants and amazing people. We tried banana dishes and pakori along with chutney. The language difference while billing was taken care by a 7 year old boy who translated the amount to be paid between his father and us. To which I feel good that kids are more smart then we think and nation is progressing, even maybe a little. The amazing local food of Kerala and the super loving people gave me the best memories of the down south.\n","date":"Dec 05","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/wayanad-kerala/","tags":["kerela","wayanad","biking","weekend travel"],"title":"Wayanad - Kerala"},{"categories":["travel"],"contents":"   IT IS BETTER TO TRAVEL WELL THAN TO ARRIVE. ~ BUDDHA  One fine weekend me and my friends from Bangalore planned to visit the famous Chikmagalur district. So I called them up on a Friday night and took a government bus on a Saturday morning. It was 4-5 hours journey from Bangalore. We all just had a bagpack with only clothes and essentials.\nWe took a lodge instead of getting into any fancy hotel. After keeping our bags we went to get a bike, which was arranged for us by my friend Arpit\u0026rsquo;s colleague at work.\nA cliff on the way to Mulyangiri\nSo we got just one bike and we were three people. Chikmangalur being a small town we planned to do tripling. After satisfying our tummies, we went for local sightseeing. Till now the trip was amazing seeing the beautiful villages around Karanataka, the weather was pleasant. We went to see a Dam and then lakes. The next day morning we had planned to visit the Mulyangiri trek. Since the region was under control of forest department, we were not able to get through bike so we parked our bike and trekked.\nView from Mulyangiri Trek\nThe trek was super amazing. Moving through the jungle and steep cliffs sometimes. It took us like less than 2 hours to reach the top and that was breathtaking. The cloud moving fast and low, flowing through us. At top there was temple so we visited there, took some rest and then started to descend back. Since we were on foot, we took lift by a lorry and came back to the town.

Lucknow, the most amazing city of memories. Such a calm city with kids playing cricket at almost every corner. That\u0026rsquo;s how I grew up at least. It has changed with time too, but still holds such a beauty every time I visit. The amazing Charbagh Railway Station to iconic Aminabad. With progressive Gomti Nagar to chilled Jankipuram and from Aashiyana to Bara Imambara. While the whole city growing around the glittering Hazratganj. This is how Lucknow has been.\nBada Imambara\nThe city is simple and serene with all people lost in happy moments of kindness and smiles. Where harmony has always prevailed because of the amazing people. I can\u0026rsquo;t even unclutter my mind with places I want to list down to visit when in Lucknow.

I was in Lucknow for Diwali and had booked a ticket via Varanasi to Bangalore to travel back after vacations. Well that was the plan, and my train was supposed to be in Varanasi 5 hours before my flight. And I must tell, you can never predict what\u0026rsquo;s gonna happen next.\nThe winters had already hit the North India and that means it will be sooner when the visibility gonna go down with dense fog. And that\u0026rsquo;s exactly what happened on 13th November 2018. My train got delayed by 4 hours and I have to miss the flight because I had missed the boarding and did not do a web check in either. So after struggle, I got a next day flight and had to stay in Varanasi. Today was another big festival which was Chhath Pooja and I experienced it in a magical way.\nView of Assi Ghat from Boats\nSo, I checked into a hotel and left to explore the amazing \u0026ldquo;Banaras ki galiyan\u0026rdquo;, i.e. streets of Varanasi. In the morning I went for Assi Ghat and saw Aftaab Shivdasni shooting for his next movie. Had some tasty Bhelpuri on the Ghats and wander around. By evening I saw the amazing Ganga River aarti. After it was time a lot of women gathered along with their families and kids to continue the Chhath Pooja Ceremony.\nChhath Pooja at Ghats of Varanasi\nI was filled with love, religion, I felt patriotic and so amazed to see the India that lives together and thrives together. I also went to few temples and experienced the magnificent structures around. With so many glittering Diyas and continuously ringing bells, it was an awestruck evening.\nAfter an amazing day in Varanasi, I had dinner and came back to my hotel room lost in the experience of life around.

We reached Kathgodam the next morning and from there we got on the shared taxis that run between Kathgodam and Nainital. It took us another hour but we were in Nainital by 8am. We had our hotel View Point Resort booked in Mallital. They arranged cabs for us to pick up from the bus stand as well, which was a good experience.\nNainital Lake\nThen we checked in and took some rest. Had tasty aloo paratha and then left for sight-seeing post lunch. We had an amazing view of Himalayas from snow view point and then took the ropeway to descend to the mall road which is a famous shopping and hanging spot for all tourists. Walked a little and explored the famous market and amazing momos. The lake was amazing so we did boating and also visited the Nanda Devi temple. The day one was pretty exhausting and spent well.\nThe next day we decided to book a cab and see the places that were a little far like Caves, Tallital and suicide point etc.\nView from Sariyatal\nIt was so amazing to see villages spread out around different lakes making the landscape more beautiful.

I had planned to travel to Dawki today. It was hardly 90Kms from here and Google Maps kept me informed that it won\u0026rsquo;t take you more than 3 hours to reach the spot. I had planned to stay at a camp in Dawki and had already called Pyndap, who was going to help me with my stay in Shnongpdeng which was the major camping coast point along Dawki river.\nSo before starting for Dawki, I gave good rest to my body and checked out at standard time. Had brunch on the way and left for Dawki to experience the point where Indian borders handovers the river to Bangladesh. It was already 3pm when I reached Mawmyrsiang and got confused which route to follow. When coming from Cherrapunji, there is a bypass via Nonglim which cuts down the travel time and distance to Dawki while the outer highway route was Umtyngar. In 2017, the bypass had started to build with no road and no vehicles passing by though that lush green villages.\nI thought to take a chance and started moving, on seeing the dark jungle before dawn, I got scared and thought to take the main road instead. So I took a U-turn after travelling like 3 km on the bypass. Sometimes in life when you are alone, you have to take a longer route cause adventure and safety should go hand in hand. But when I returned back to the main road I saw few Taxi\u0026rsquo;s carrying tourist taking the bypass, so I again took a U-turn and followed the Taxis instead of being alone on the bypass. It was scary and thrilling at the same time.\nBy 4.30pm, I was in Dawki. Yeah, I got late cause I was strangled in thoughts for choosing the right and safe journey. Also, when traveling to Dawki there were times with plain old farms and no humans around. No vehicle, no animals and not even internet for streches like 10kms. On seeing the Indian Military, I felt relieved.\nSince, I didn\u0026rsquo;t have much planned I did boating in the cleanest river and enjoyed the sunset. Also, there is a market for exchange between India and Bangladesh border running on boats. I enjoyed the evening and went to my camp later.\nCamping along Dawki River in Shnongpdeng\nAfter an exciting day, I met Pyndap and his friends, Lur Talang and others. We shared some drinks and enjoyed great non-vegetarian food along the Dawki river with conversations around great music that Meghalaya has seen.\nThe next day was so warm and good, I planned to return to Shillong and prepare for my journey back to Lucknow.\nAlso, here is a link to a song which that helped me writing this post.\nCrosstown Traffic by Jimi Hendrix\n","date":"Oct 11","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/dawki-and-bangladesh-border/","tags":["meghalaya","dawki","bangladesh border","camping"],"title":"Dawki - And the Bangladesh Border"},{"categories":["travel"],"contents":"   THE WAY I SEE IT, IF YOU WANT THE RAINBOW, YOU GOTTA PUT UP WITH THE RAIN. ~ DOLLY PARTON  Laitlum Grand Canyon View from Shillong - Cherrapunji Highway\nOnce I started for Cherrapunji, it was cold morning already with no sun and the sky covered with blanket of cloud. The sky was white and I knew that it is going to rain today. Also, the Geography books that I read since my childhood told me, Cherrapunji receives the highest rainfall every year. So it was sure that was going to rain today. I started in bright sun at around 10AM in the morning but while I reach the Latilum, the sun was no more following. From highway to Cherrapunji, it was an amazing view of Latilum Grand Canyon. The green lush hills, all standing together like a band and the winds playing the beautiful music in synchronicity. I took a break and enjoyed the view before continuing.\nBy around 5PM, I reached the calm and serene Sohra, where I checked into my hotel and took some rest from long driving day. Late in the evening, I explored the surroundings. There were no big restaurants or shops. Local people running canteens and selling daily goods across corners. The most amazing thing I noticed all the way in Meghalaya that everywhere I went, it was pretty neat and clean. I had my dinner and came back to room. Also it started drizzling.\nNext day was warm. I woke up early in the morning at 5AM and started for the Double Decker Root Bridge because I wanted to see this natural bridge formed by locked roots of Banyan tree. It was not easy to reach there. After 12km of bike ride into the valley, I reached a stop from where I had to trek for about 6KM. I was alone, tired and scared of the jungle at 6.30AM in the morning. I didn\u0026rsquo;t knew what\u0026rsquo;s ahead. So I took a local guide with me. His name was Kevin. I had a bluetooth speaker in which I was playing few songs so Kevin asked me to play few of his favorites. I explored great 90\u0026rsquo;s music with him and one of my favorite is Country Roads take me home by John Denver.\nWe trekked to Living root bridge and it was magnificent.\nDouble Decker Living Root Bridge - Tyrna Village, Cherrapunji\nI was all exhausted with the 6km already and I had to trek back so to keep up my energy, I had maggi and tea at Wahlang Tea Stall. After an hour break I started to trek back and it was not easy. With energy going down and stairs going up, this was the toughest afternoon ever. This 12km of round trip had got me cramps in my legs so I went back and took rest for the day.\nThe next day I went for the great view of Seven Sister Waterfalls, Eco Park and Mawsmai Caves which were equally beautiful places. Did some shopping, enjoyed the drizzles in the evening and took rest to start the journey next day to Dawki.\n","date":"Oct 10","permalink":"https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/cherrapunji-or-sohra-october-drizzles/","tags":["meghalaya","solo travel","cherrapunji","sohra"],"title":"Cherrapunji or Sohra - October Drizzles"},{"categories":["travel"],"contents":"   I THINK THAT\u0026amp;rsquo;S WHAT IT IS WITH ROCK MUSIC.

It was drizzling when I started, got a little drenched as well. While I reached the city, I saw an amazing evening with an ongoing football match at Malki Grounds, meanwhile the sun was setting down. Then I went to my stay and met some amazing Graphic Designers from Shillong, and had a good time in rock city.\nNext day I went to explore some of Shillong and visited one of the beautiful Shillong peak and Elephant falls. Shillong peak is a small hill that gives you all the overview of the city.\nAlso, Elephant falls were wide and massive though it depends at what time of season you visit the falls.\nOn my way back I visited Police Bazaar to explore local cuisines and shops. There I found a shop serving tasty and hot Momos with Chicken soup. This was the first time I learned that Momos are meant to be served with Soup. That\u0026rsquo;s how they do it in North-East India.\nMy original plan was to visit the NH7 weekender in Shillong too, but unfortunately the events date got shifted and I was here is Shillong thinking where to go next.
