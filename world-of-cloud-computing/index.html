<p><img src="../assets/images/tech/cloud.jpeg" alt="s3-and-lambda" /></p>
<p>Technology has moved to the cloud, it was just 11 years ago when I was puzzled by the word cloud computing. Luckily back then I had access to <strong>free</strong> internet and Google search engine to kill my curiosity.</p>
<p>It was when I was sitting copying all the pictures from the college fest to a pen drive so that we can share them with everyone else. The world has now changed to &quot;<em>I will share on Google photos!!</em>&quot;  Well that is cloud storage for you. <strong>What's next?</strong></p>
<p>Cloud gives you the flexibility to store all your data backups on to a remote server far far away. We just need to trust enough that the cloud providers have a better Hard Drive that won't crash ever. Haha. Obviously, we gotta pay for the access. And if you think it's free, then it is only till we all get addicted, just like the internet and smartphones.</p>
<p><img src="../assets/images/tech/4.jpeg" alt="mobile crowd.jpeg" /></p>
<p>Then comes cloud computing when you don't need those graphics renderers and the crazy system requirements for your computer. All CPU, GPU that is required to run a heavy software or game is done on the cloud, all you need is a damn fast internet connection. It isn't too far when XBOX and PS will be obsolete.  <a href="https://stadia.google.com/">Google Stadia</a>  is almost there to crash it all on gaming.</p>
<p>With cloud computing becoming the next big thing, we will only need an interactive screen, a browser, and a cloud provider. Oh, we already have Chrome and smartphones. Yeah, we just need to <strong>buy</strong> subscriptions. No cracks and activation cheats! There you go, Netflix and Chill!</p>
<p><strong>What do you think? What else will revolutionize technology in the future?</strong> 
<em>Do share your thoughts in the comments below and spare my sarcasm.</em> :p</p>
