## Of all the India that I've seen, this was different.

This was when first wave of Corona was over and things were at ease. So I left home to be in the remotest from where I can work peacefully. All those months in lockdown were really depressing and I felt to the core how it feels to be caged. Well I wanted to be free and so I took a one way ticket to Siliguri in January 2021. From there I went to Darjeeling to break my journey.
