## Of all the India that I've seen, this was different.

This was when first wave of Corona was over and things were at ease. So I left home to be in the remotest from where I can work peacefully. All those months in lockdown were really depressing and I felt to the core how it feels to be caged. Well I wanted to be free and so I took a one way ticket to Siliguri in January 2021. From there I went to Darjeeling to break my journey. 

The main town in Darjeeling is good to stay and chiil but it was a little dirty and full of thrash at almost all places around. Since I was working from Hide Out Darjeeling, a cozy bagpacking hostel. After my one week stay I moved to Gangtok.

### Never seen a city so civilised and clean - Gangtok
Gangtok seemed like it belongs to another country and isn't affected by the typical Indian mindset.  I was impressed by the way it was clean, people taking footover bridges to cross roads. My biggest surprise was no unnecessary honking. People seemed free, independent and thriving in the best atmosphere.

To be continued.
