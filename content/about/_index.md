Hello there!

First of all, thank you for your precious time to read the most useless content. ðŸ‘¹

I'm an engineer and technologist at heart who loves writing code and learning more about it. 
My curiosity around technology is driving me to write this blog. The question is how long? ðŸ™„

Well, I absolutely love to travel and explore cuisines. On a path to be a full time digital nomad sooner. So, I like hiking, adventures, and swimming. ðŸŽª

Apart from playing around with softwares, I write songs, even love composing & singing at times. Have you checked out my music yet? [Explore now!](HTTP://devutkarsh.com) ðŸŽ¸

Anyways, now you know me enough, let's connect maybe? Don't let it be just another useless content you read. Haha. ðŸ‘»

Hope to hear from you!
