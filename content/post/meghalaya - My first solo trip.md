## GREAT THINGS NEVER CAME FROM COMFORT ZONES.


There was a time I loved computers and Internet. Well a pretty neat invention of all time, getting us all done with a click. From having a virtual social life to setting up business, from making travels plan easier to flying to Moon & back. 

  

Yes! We can have it all. But what we have? A machine holding us from all the beautiful adventures out there and making us well assured that this life is easy and amazing at the same time.


I had a pretty great time in 11 years span from school to college and then at work, all made easy with technology.  Until I started to realise, that work places are totally life changing, which plugs out the real country boy from you and turn you into a professional with jitters.

  

I've been traveling for 2-3 years now, always taking small trips with friends & sometimes colleagues to nearby beaches and mountains. That was the time when people wanted to travel North-East India and explore the unknown 7 states of the country. With multiple failed plans in group, I decided not to waste time anymore and take a solo trip, and that was it.

Punjabi Dhaba at NH27. Enroute to Shillong from Guwahati.

So, I read a lot of blogs, planned 2 weeks off from office and booked a one way air ticket to Guwahati, Assam. I planned 9 days to explore Meghalaya and then travel to my home town in [Lucknow](../lucknow-uttar-pradesh-city-of-nawabs), [Uttar Pradesh](#) via train - Guwahati New Delhi Special.

  
As I started my journey on Saturday morning from Bangalore. Travelling all the way to the airport, such a long ride, I started at 6 in the morning with a flight to depart at 9:20am. I was in Guwahati by 12 noon. Outside the airport was a freedom with warmth of Assam. I took a taxi to [Himalayan Phoenix](https://goo.gl/maps/8uLza3TQU6qFRrFAA) Bike Rental from where I had pre-enquired for booking a Royal Enfield.  
  
After a little lunch, I went for Shillong, Meghalaya by 3pm on a long highway of National Highway 27.  
  
By 7pm in the evening I was in Shillong, figuring out how to reach my Airbnb host, Ritchin who is a graphic designer & an amazing sketch artist.  
  
Had a great time in [Shillong](../shillong-rock-capital-of-india) and then in [Cherrapunji](../cherrapunji-or-sohra-october-drizzles) and [Dawki](../dawki-and-bangladesh-border). Please visit individual links to read further about my experiences from each town of Meghalaya.  While returning I stayed a day in Shillong. After riding to Guwahati all day long next day, I grabbed a beer at [Underdogs](https://g.page/UnderdoggsGuwahati?share) and hopped on the train to [Lucknow](../lucknow-uttar-pradesh-city-of-nawabs).  
  

While I was writing all this, I am also planning a trip to [Auli](../auli-joshimath-snow-skii-india), [Uttrakhand](#).

  

You too can be a part of great memories, it's just you have to plan it out and do it, anyways. 

Money is all papers. Have a good day.    

Also, here is a link to a song which that helped me writing this post.
