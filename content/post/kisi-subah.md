A night of September 2018 and some random weekend when I was chilling with my friends at a house party in Bangalore. Most of the weekends (and even weekdays) you will find almost all IT employees here grabbing a drink and catching up with friends or colleagues. So just like everyone else, I was enjoying it too. Though on the other side of the story there was someone waiting for that daily call and I was breaking a habit tonight, which pissed her off. Also, I get bored with mundane. Soon after the party was over and the new day was rising, we went to Nandi Hills to watch the sunrise, again just following what all Bangaloreans do when up awake early. So I was at Nandi Hills when I wrote few lines and turned it into a poerty eventually.

Soon after it was poetry, I was really moved by the structure it had in the lyrics, enough to add some music and make it a song. Within few months I had a half-baked song with all the chords to get the verse and chorus together. And as usual, it was all scattered in my personal diary, google keep app, and a lot more in my head. Having a very scarce time and almost no music production skills were hindering to let it be a fully produced song.

> This is the problem as I see it. I don't belong in the music industry and thus have very few people with the same interest to work with. There is a huge sea to cross, from where you are and where you want to be.

So then here was 2020, a time in itself in which I invested carefully in brushing up on production skills while staying indoors. If this pandemic would not have happened, I would have probably quit my job in IT and have gone out to be a full-time traveler (just another lifestyle I would love to live). But this is the beauty with time, it comes with maturity if you are ready to learn from all your past mistakes. Eventually, I prepared a scratch with my very very basic music production skills and shared it with Ankit to have a look and convert it into a neat art, which he does as always!
