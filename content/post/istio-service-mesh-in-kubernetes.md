Getting a kubernetes cluster up and runnign is fairly easy now. But I've seen challenges like -
- how to moinitor the network flow ?
- how does the ingress traffic is controller ?
- how you authenticate requests ?
- how to get health status for your services ?
- and many more

Then I came across this amazing tool named Istio service-mesh.
