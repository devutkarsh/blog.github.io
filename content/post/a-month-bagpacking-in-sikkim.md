## Of all the India that I&rsquo;ve seen, this was different.

This was when first wave of Corona was over and things were at ease. So I left home to be in the remotest from where I can work peacefully. All those months in lockdown were really depressing and I felt to the core how it feels to be caged. Well I wanted to be free and so I took a one way ticket to Siliguri. From there I went to Darjeeling to break my journey. 

The main town in Darjeeling is good to stay and chiil but it is small place to explore. Since I was working from Hide Out Darjeeling, a cozy bagpacking hostel. After my one week stay I moved to Gangtok.
### Never seen a city so civilised and clean - Gangtok
Gangtok seemed like it belongs to another country and isn't affected by the typical Indian mindset.  I was so impressed, the way it was clean, people taking footover bridges to cross roads. My biggest surprise was no unnecessary honking. People seemed free, independent and thriving in the best atmosphere. I stayed in Tag Along Bagpackers. A very well maintained travelers hostel and Travel Cafe ran by few childhood friends.

Travel Cafe was one such place where I was chilling almost all the time. Thanks to Sharan for keeping the music and the vibe alive, I didn't needed my headphone while working here. I fell in love with this song, *A Different Age by Current Joys*. The weather was so chilling in winters here and I was working with some amazing streaming code snippet.

To be continued.
