This is not just a tech blog but a story behind as well. I recently switched my job and moved from AWS to Azure at workplace. Also, I am exploring GCP for my personal stuff. Still I don't know enough to choose a personal favorite. ðŸ˜‹ 

## What's your biggest skill?

The most interesting question I ever had in any interview is, ***"What drives you to be a better engineer?"*** To which my never changing thought is I am a curious person. I like exploring out in the wild while trekking or diving deep in System32 tinkering with DLL's to make things work my way. It all goes back to highschool when I revamped Windows XP and made my first static website. All because of **Curiosity!**
