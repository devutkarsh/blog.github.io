<p>Just the end of 2014 after graduating from college, I started my first job in Mumbai. While I was just a learner of professionalism at workplace, I met many like minded acquaintances and became friends in no time. After all the amazing trainings were done, the 2 month program had also created amazing friendships. So with all these friends, we planned a day trip to Bhandardhara which was a village just 185km from Mumbai. There weren't many reviews on the web then, so had to figure it ourselves.</p>

<p>Boat ride to cross the lake to Ratanwadi</p>
<p>After reaching Bhandardara, there we had to take a boat ride to cross the lake and visit the Ratanwadi village. As we reached Ratanwadi, we realised that it was a small place with a temple and very few houses. There was no restaurant and we all were hungry, when a villages agreed to prepare food for all 10 people. We had stunning food and wanted to trek to the Ratanwadi fort, but we were already running late and had least stamina to go for trek.</p>

<p>Since, we had booked a traveler bus and had to also head back, most of them backed out to go for a trek as it was getting late. So we missed the trek which was supposed to give us the breathtaking view of Mumbai city. But understanding the need of the friends, we skipped the trek and after enjoying the beautiful Ratanwadi village we left back for Mumbai. It was a great day and great village indeed.</p>
