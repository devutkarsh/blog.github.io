<p>There was a time I loved computers and Internet. Well a pretty neat invention of all time, getting us all done with a click. From having a virtual social life to setting up business, from making travels plan easier to flying to Moon &amp; back. </p>
<p>Yes! We can have it all. But what we have? A machine holding us from all the beautiful adventures out there and making us well assured that this life is easy and amazing at the same time.</p>
<p>I had a pretty great time in 11 years span from school to college and then at work, all made easy with technology.  Until I started to realise, that work places are totally life changing, which plugs out the real country boy from you and turn you into a professional with jitters.</p>
<p>I've been traveling for 2-3 years now, always taking small trips with friends &amp; sometimes colleagues to nearby beaches and mountains. That was the time when people wanted to travel North-East India and explore the unknown 7 states of the country. With multiple failed plans in group, I decided not to waste time anymore and take a solo trip, and that was it.</p>

<p>Punjabi Dhaba at NH27. Enroute to Shillong from Guwahati.</p>
<p>So, I read a lot of blogs, planned 2 weeks off from office and booked a one way air ticket to Guwahati, Assam. I planned 9 days to explore Meghalaya and then travel to my home town in <a href="../lucknow-uttar-pradesh-city-of-nawabs">Lucknow</a>, <a href="https://blog.devutkarsh.com/meghalaya-my-first-solo-trip/#">Uttar Pradesh</a> via train - Guwahati New Delhi Special.</p>
<p>As I started my journey on Saturday morning from Bangalore. Travelling all the way to the airport, such a long ride, I started at 6 in the morning with a flight to depart at 9:20am. I was in Guwahati by 12 noon. Outside the airport was a freedom with warmth of Assam. I took a taxi to <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/8uLza3TQU6qFRrFAA">Himalayan Phoenix</a> Bike Rental from where I had pre-enquired for booking a Royal Enfield.</p>
<p>After a little lunch, I went for Shillong, Meghalaya by 3pm on a long highway of National Highway 27.</p>
<p>By 7pm in the evening I was in Shillong, figuring out how to reach my Airbnb host, Ritchin who is a graphic designer &amp; an amazing sketch artist.</p>
<p>Had a great time in <a href="../shillong-rock-capital-of-india">Shillong</a> and then in <a href="../cherrapunji-or-sohra-october-drizzles">Cherrapunji</a> and <a href="../dawki-and-bangladesh-border">Dawki</a>. Please visit individual links to read further about my experiences from each town of Meghalaya.  While returning I stayed a day in Shillong. After riding to Guwahati all day long next day, I grabbed a beer at <a href="https://g.page/UnderdoggsGuwahati?share">Underdogs</a> and hopped on the train to <a href="../lucknow-uttar-pradesh-city-of-nawabs">Lucknow</a>.</p>
<h4 id="while-i-was-writing-all-this-i-am-also-planning-a-trip-to-auli-uttrakhand">While I was writing all this, I am also planning a trip to <a href="../auli-joshimath-snow-skii-india">Auli</a>, <a href="https://blog.devutkarsh.com/meghalaya-my-first-solo-trip/#">Uttrakhand</a>.</h4>
<p>You too can be a part of great memories, it's just you have to plan it out and do it, anyways. </p>
<p>Money is all papers. Have a good day.</p>
<p>Also, here is a link to a song which that helped me writing this post.<br />
