I have been to Pondicherry twice. Once with my friend and band&amp;rsquo;s drummer, Ankit Godle and next time with my friends from Bangalore. Both time from I travelled from Bangalore, once by bus and next time taking a self-driving car.
The first time I visited was in 2016, when I visited Chennai to meet Ankit for a new song composition. On reaching Chennai we thought to visit Pondicherry and so made a spontaneous plan and took a bus to Pondicherry.</description></item></channel></rss>
