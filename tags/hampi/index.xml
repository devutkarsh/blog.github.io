It is a beautifully broken Hindu kingdom along Tungabhadra river which is just 300km from Bangalore. So one weekend I planned to travel and went with my friends to reveal the history behind. We took a direct train from Yeshwantpur railway station on a Friday evening to Hosapete to cover the most of the journey and then took an auto rickshaw to travel the remaining 10km and arrived at Hampi on a warm Saturaday morning.</description></item></channel></rss>
