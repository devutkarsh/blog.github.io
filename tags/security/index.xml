Edge authentication or authorization is a way to validate all the requests before they reach the actual microservice or private networks i.e. at the edge. This is done at a global level for all the services, so that individual microservice do not have to handle the authentication or authorization on thier own.
This removes the security overhead from all microservices so that they can communicate insecurely in the mesh within a private network and focus on only concerned business logic.</description></item></channel></rss>
