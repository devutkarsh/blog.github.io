Lucknow, the most amazing city of memories. Such a calm city with kids playing cricket at almost every corner. That&amp;rsquo;s how I grew up at least. It has changed with time too, but still holds such a beauty every time I visit. The amazing Charbagh Railway Station to iconic Aminabad. With progressive Gomti Nagar to chilled Jankipuram and from Aashiyana to Bara Imambara.</description></item><item><title>Varanasi or Kashi - City of Ghats</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/varanasi-or-kashi-city-of-ghats/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/varanasi-or-kashi-city-of-ghats/</guid><description>ADVENTURE IS WORTHWHILE. ~ ARISTOTLE It was just two days after my birthday. I was in Lucknow for Diwali and had booked a ticket via Varanasi to Bangalore to travel back after vacations. Well that was the plan, and my train was supposed to be in Varanasi 5 hours before my flight. And I must tell, you can never predict what&amp;rsquo;s gonna happen next.
The winters had already hit the North India and that means it will be sooner when the visibility gonna go down with dense fog.</description></item></channel></rss>
