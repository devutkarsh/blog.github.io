It is a beautifully broken Hindu kingdom along Tungabhadra river which is just 300km from Bangalore. So one weekend I planned to travel and went with my friends to reveal the history behind. We took a direct train from Yeshwantpur railway station on a Friday evening to Hosapete to cover the most of the journey and then took an auto rickshaw to travel the remaining 10km and arrived at Hampi on a warm Saturaday morning.</description></item><item><title>Chikmagalur, Karnataka - The Mullayanagiri Trek</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/chikmagalur-karnataka-mullayanagiri-trek/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/post/chikmagalur-karnataka-mullayanagiri-trek/</guid><description>IT IS BETTER TO TRAVEL WELL THAN TO ARRIVE. ~ BUDDHA One fine weekend me and my friends from Bangalore planned to visit the famous Chikmagalur district. So I called them up on a Friday night and took a government bus on a Saturday morning. It was 4-5 hours journey from Bangalore. We all just had a bagpack with only clothes and essentials.
We took a lodge instead of getting into any fancy hotel.</description></item></channel></rss>
