It was 11th of October 2017, I had already been tired with solo journey and exhausting treks of Cherrapunji. I had planned to travel to Dawki today. It was hardly 90Kms from here and Google Maps kept me informed that it won&amp;rsquo;t take you more than 3 hours to reach the spot. I had planned to stay at a camp in Dawki and had already called Pyndap, who was going to help me with my stay in Shnongpdeng which was the major camping coast point along Dawki river.</description></item></channel></rss>
