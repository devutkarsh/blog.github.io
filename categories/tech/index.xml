But hereâ€™s the tough truth:
Many companies are burning cloud money unnecessarily because developers are using Databricks notebooks as an all-in-one development environment â€” even for tasks that donâ€™t need cluster power.
This article explores why this behavior is costly, how to shift towards local-first development, and how to use the Databricks CLI to push only the final, distributed workloads to the cloud â€” saving your company potentially thousands of dollars per month.</description></item><item><title>The story of Multi-Cloud!</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/the-story-of-multi-cloud/</link><pubDate>Wed, 05 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/the-story-of-multi-cloud/</guid><description>This is not just a tech blog but a story behind as well.

Nginx, a powerful and flexible web server, is a popular choice for this purpose. In this post, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use Nginx as a load balancer service on Kubernetes using YAML manifests, avoiding the complexity of Helm, and making it understandable that how nginx works.</description></item><item><title>No downtime for microservices</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/no-downtime-for-microservices/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 Dec 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/no-downtime-for-microservices/</guid><description>Achieving No Downtime in Kubernetes Deployments Introduction Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform that enables the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. When deploying applications in a production environment, minimizing downtime is crucial to ensure a seamless user experience. In this article, we will explore strategies and best practices to achieve zero or minimal downtime during Kubernetes deployments.
1. Rolling Deployments One of the fundamental features of Kubernetes is rolling deployments.</description></item><item><title>Edge Auth - Authentication - Part 1</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/edge-auth-authentication-part-1/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/edge-auth-authentication-part-1/</guid><description>What is edge authentication? Edge authentication or authorization is a way to validate all the requests before they reach the actual microservice or private networks i.e. at the edge. This is done at a global level for all the services, so that individual microservice do not have to handle the authentication or authorization on thier own. This removes the security overhead from all microservices so that they can communicate insecurely in the mesh within a private network and focus on only concerned business logic.</description></item><item><title>Istio service mesh in kubernetes</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/istio-service-mesh-in-kubernetes/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/istio-service-mesh-in-kubernetes/</guid><description>Setting up Istio Service Mesh on Kubernetes Getting a kubernetes cluster up and running is fairly easy now. But I&amp;rsquo;ve seen challenges like -
How to moinitor the network flow &amp;amp; health? How to ingress traffic is microservices ? How to do canary deployments &amp;amp; prevent downtimes? How to perform Auth on incoming requests? Then I came across this amazing service-mesh bundle for my infrastucture layer specially made for distributed systems running on Kubernetes.</description></item><item><title>Configuring Kubernetes for Multiple Environments with Kustomize</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/configuring-kubernetes-for-multiple-environments-with-kustomize/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/configuring-kubernetes-for-multiple-environments-with-kustomize/</guid><description>Kubernetes Configuration Management for DEV, Staging, QA, Production, etc - So you may have learned so far how to set up a kuberentes cluster and how to write a manifest and then deploy a pod out of it. If not please refer to my post on getting started with kuberenetes manifests. But you may still be puzzled about how to configure it for multiple environments. Yes, it is possible to use a single deployment and service template to be used for multiple environments.</description></item><item><title>Getting started with Kubernetes Manifests</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/getting-started-with-kubernetes-manifests/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/getting-started-with-kubernetes-manifests/</guid><description>Deploy your first container on Kuberentes cluster Well if you have followed us on the previous blog post on how to create a kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS or have gone with local kubernetes clusters like minikube etc. Then you must be aware that to manage all the resources &amp;amp; objects on your cluster you will need a command-line tool kubectl which interacts on your behalf with the kube-api-server to perform almost all operations on your cluster.</description></item><item><title>Streaming AWS S3 objects in AWS EKS cluster</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/streaming-aws-s3-objects-in-aws-eks-cluster/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/streaming-aws-s3-objects-in-aws-eks-cluster/</guid><description>Java spring-boot microservice to read objects from AWS S3 bucket that can be accessed by other microservices over HTTP I recently came across a requirement to host static content for my microservices running on the AWS EKS cluster.
Since there were multiple services that will be accessing different objects so I thought to create a common S3 bucket for hosting and gave S3ReadAccess to my cluster.
This saves effort on the microservices end.</description></item><item><title>How to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS EKS</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/how-to-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-eks/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Jul 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/how-to-create-a-kubernetes-cluster-on-aws-eks/</guid><description>Using self-managed Amazon EC2 nodes (No Fargate) To create a kubernetes cluster on aws eks, we would be using the aws cli and eksctl that needs to be installed on your local command line as a pre-requisite.
Your aws cli should be configured with the access token and secret of your aws console and your user should have right aws IAM access role.
Now as you have this ready, we will be creating a config file named as cluster.</description></item><item><title>Using AWS S3 and Lambda to process file chunks</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/using-aws-s3-and-lambda-to-process-file-chunks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/using-aws-s3-and-lambda-to-process-file-chunks/</guid><description>Merge file parts/chunks in S3 on receive - PUT object by invoking lambda Sending files in chunks over the network is most common because it&amp;rsquo;s easy to apply a retry mechanism over failed parts. On receiving all the parts then the parts or chunks are merged together to create one single file. We all know how frustrating is to see download failing at 99%.

Technology has moved to the cloud, it was just 11 years ago when I was puzzled by the word cloud computing. Luckily back then I had access to free internet and Google search engine to kill my curiosity.
It was when I was sitting copying all the pictures from the college fest to a pen drive so that we can share them with everyone else.</description></item><item><title>API-microgateway service using Netflix Zuul on Java</title><link>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/api-microgateway-service-using-netflix-zuul-on-java/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.devutkarsh.com/api-microgateway-service-using-netflix-zuul-on-java/</guid><description>How to write an api-service or edge-service or api-gateway? So we are here today to write a gateway microservice using Springboot framework, Netflix&amp;rsquo;s Zuul library, and our never-getting-old programming language Java. As a part of this development, we will be using Gradle to build this together and prepare the Docker image out of it.

The biggest driving force will always be curiosity, and if you have it, your focus will lead you where you want to be!
I have always been curios to explore, the wild in nature, the depth in music and everything else. Always trying to learn more and grasp knowledge while grow spritually. But that becomes problematic if you try to hop on multiple boats because time is quantifiable.</description></item></channel></rss>
